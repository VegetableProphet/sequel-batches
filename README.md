# Sequel::Batches

This dataset extension provides the method #in_batches. The method splits dataset in parts and yields it.

You can set following options:
  - pk Overrides primary key of your dataset
  - of sets chunk size (1000 by default)
  - start as a hash { <column>: <start_value> } represents frame start for batch processing
  - finish as a hash represents frame end

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sequel-batches'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sequel-batches

## Usage

In order to use the feature you should enable the extension

```ruby
Sequel::DATABASES.first.extension :batches
```

And then the method becomes available on dataset

```ruby
User.where(role: "admin").in_batches(of: 4) do |ds|
  ds.delete
end
```

Finally, here's an example including all the available options

```ruby
Event.where(type: "login").in_batches(of: 4, pk: [:project_id, :external_user_id], start: { project_id: 2, external_user_id: 3 }, finish: { project_id: 5, external_user_id: 70 }) do |ds|
  ds.delete
end
```
